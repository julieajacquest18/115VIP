## A Personal Note from the Editor

I‚Äôve been in the crypto space for 6 years and have used over a dozen different trading platforms. The first piece of advice I‚Äôd give to anyone new to this field is: **protect your assets before thinking about making money!**

Many beginners are lured in by stories of others making hundreds of times their investment through leveraged trading. However, the foundation of making a profit lies in keeping your principal safe. Unfortunately, no trading platform can guarantee 100% security for your funds.

This guide is specially tailored for beginners in Mainland China, helping you avoid unnecessary losses, scams, and other risks. Below are simple steps for purchasing Bitcoin in China.

## Steps to Buy Bitcoin for Mainland Chinese Users

1. **Register on a Bitcoin trading platform**  
   Currently, major platforms include Binance, Huobi, OKX, and Gate. These platforms require identity verification for deposits and trades.

2. **Download the trading platform app**  
   Identity verification is often app-exclusive, so ensure you download their official application.

3. **Fund your account with RMB**  
   Use trusted channels like Alipay or bank transfers to deposit RMB, which can then be converted into USDT.

4. **Buy Bitcoin using USDT**  
   Once you have USDT in your account, you can use it to purchase Bitcoin, which will be stored in your platform‚Äôs account.

5. **Transfer Bitcoin to your wallet**  
   For better security, create a Bitcoin address in a mobile or hardware wallet, and transfer your Bitcoin to this wallet.

## How to Evaluate a Bitcoin Exchange?

To minimize risks and safeguard your assets, **never keep all your funds on just one or two exchanges**. Even major exchanges have faced crises. For example, the collapse of FTX and smaller Chinese-run platforms like Hoo and AEX left countless users with significant losses.

### Key Factors for Choosing a Reliable Exchange:

1. **Security**  
   Licensed exchanges are generally more secure, as they‚Äôve passed at least one level of government oversight. For example, Coinbase is a compliant exchange. However, compliant exchanges may have limited coin offerings and lack leverage trading options.  
   For greater flexibility, international exchanges like **OKX** and Binance are better choices. A simple rule of thumb: **the longer a founder has spent in jail, the safer the exchange.** Experienced founders understand the consequences of mishandling user assets, making them more cautious.

2. **Trading Depth**  
   Trading depth measures how well a market can handle large orders without significant price fluctuations. Look for exchanges with high liquidity, where bid-ask spreads are narrow, ensuring smoother transactions.

3. **Stability**  
   Reliable exchanges should not experience frequent outages, especially during high-volatility periods. Exchanges like OKX have significantly improved their server performance, providing a much better trading experience compared to traditional stock platforms.

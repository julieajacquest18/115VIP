## Understanding the OKX Fee Structure

Before diving into fee reduction strategies, it's essential to understand how OKX fees are structured. OKX primarily charges trading fees for **spot trading** and **contract trading**.

### **Spot Trading Fees**
- **Maker Fees**: For users who place orders that add liquidity to the order book (e.g., limit orders). Maker fees are generally lower.
- **Taker Fees**: For users who place orders that match existing orders on the order book. Taker fees are slightly higher.

### **Contract Trading Fees**
- Similar to spot trading, fees for contract trading are categorized into **maker** and **taker** fees.
- Contract trading fees may vary based on the leverage used, with higher leverage often resulting in higher fees.

Fee percentages vary depending on the user's **VIP level** and the number of **OKB tokens** held.

2. **Hold OKB Tokens**: OKB, the native token of OKX, plays a vital role in determining your VIP level. Holding more OKB tokens can elevate your VIP status.

#### Benefits of Higher VIP Levels:
- Higher VIP levels unlock greater discounts. For instance:

  - **VIP6**: Significantly reduced fees across all trading types.

1. Go to **Account Settings** in your OKX profile.
2. Enable the option to use OKB tokens for fee payments.
3. Once enabled, OKX will automatically deduct fees in OKB, offering up to **20% discounts**.

#### How to Acquire OKB:
- Purchase OKB directly from OKX's spot market.
- Participate in OKB staking programs to earn additional rewards while holding your tokens.

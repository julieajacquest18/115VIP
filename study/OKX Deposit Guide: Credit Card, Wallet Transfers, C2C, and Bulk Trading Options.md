   Log in to the OKX website or app, click on the "Buy Crypto" tab, and select "Quick Buy."

   Specify the fiat currency amount you wish to pay, and the system will display the equivalent cryptocurrency amount based on current exchange rates.

3. **Choose Payment Method**:  
   Select your preferred payment option, such as **VISA**, **Mastercard**, or alternative payment systems like **PayPal** or **LINE Pay** (availability depends on your region).

## 2. Wallet Transfers

For users who already hold cryptocurrency in external wallets, transferring funds to OKX is a convenient option.

### Steps to Deposit via Wallet Transfer:

1. **Retrieve Your OKX Wallet Address**:  
   - Go to the "Assets" section in your OKX account.
   - Select "Deposit" and choose the cryptocurrency you wish to transfer.
   - Copy the wallet address or scan the QR code.

2. **Initiate the Transfer from Your External Wallet**:  
   Use a wallet or another exchange (e.g., Binance, Coinbase) to send funds to the copied OKX wallet address.

3. **Verify the Transaction**:  
   Once the transaction is initiated, monitor its progress on the blockchain and ensure it reflects in your OKX wallet.

### Important Considerations:
- Always double-check the **network type** (e.g., ERC-20, TRC-20) and wallet address to avoid irreversible mistakes.
- If you're new to crypto, test the process with a small amount before transferring larger sums.

## 3. C2C Transactions (Peer-to-Peer)

OKXâ€™s **C2C (Customer-to-Customer)** trading option connects buyers and sellers for direct transactions. The platform acts as a mediator, ensuring secure transactions.

### How to Deposit via C2C:

1. **Access the C2C Trading Section**:  
   Go to the "Buy Crypto" tab and select "C2C."

2. **Browse Offers**:  
   View available sellers, their prices, transaction limits, and accepted payment methods (e.g., local bank transfers).

3. **Place an Order**:  
   Choose a seller that meets your criteria, initiate a trade, and follow the payment instructions provided.

4. **Confirm Payment**:  
   After sending funds, mark the payment as completed, and the seller will release the cryptocurrency to your OKX wallet.

### Notes:

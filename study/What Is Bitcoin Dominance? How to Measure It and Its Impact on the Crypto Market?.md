# What Is Bitcoin Dominance? How to Measure It and Its Impact on the Crypto Market?

As Bitcoin's supply growth slows and demand rises, its dominance in the crypto market continues to strengthen.

In the 2017 bull market, Bitcoin maintained over 80% market dominance. However, during the 2021 bull run, this figure dropped to the 50â€“60% range. Now, excitement around ETFs and the upcoming halving event has pushed its dominance back to 54%, the highest level since April 2021.

What is Bitcoin dominance? Why has it regained investors' attention? And what does the rise in Bitcoin dominance mean for the broader cryptocurrency market?

## Bitcoin Dominance Reaches 2021 Levels

Bitcoinâ€™s market dominance (BTC.D) dropped below 50% after April 2021. However, as Bitcoinâ€™s price rallied, its dominance surged between March and June, hitting a local high of around 52%, its highest level since April 2021.

As of October 26, 2023, Bitcoinâ€™s market dominance stands at 54%, a 30-month high.

Bitcoin halving events occur every four years, reducing mining rewards per block and decreasing the inflow of new Bitcoins into the market. The next halving will reduce rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block.

The rise in dominance also highlights a significant trend: while altcoins occasionally see gains, the majority of market recovery is concentrated in Bitcoin. As a result, Bitcoinâ€™s market capitalization has exceeded $587 billion, accounting for over half of the total cryptocurrency market cap.

According to analyst Noelle Acheson, Bitcoinâ€™s safe-haven appeal and ETF momentum are driving its dominance over altcoins like Ethereum. Historically, Bitcoin leads during early market cycles until investors gain confidence in higher-risk assets.

Bitcoinâ€™s dominance indicates its strength as the crypto market waits for the next major catalyst. But what is Bitcoin dominance, and why is it important?

## What Is Bitcoin Dominance?

Bitcoin dominance refers to Bitcoinâ€™s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. In other words, it represents the percentage of the crypto market's total value that Bitcoin accounts for. This metric, also known as Bitcoin's dominance ratio or Bitcoin dominance index, provides insights into the current market environment and potential opportunities.

### 1. What Is Cryptocurrency Market Cap?

To understand Bitcoin dominance, we first need to grasp the concept of market capitalization.

The market cap of a cryptocurrency is its total market value, calculated by multiplying the number of coins or tokens in circulation by their current market price.

For example:
- **Bitcoin Market Cap** = Circulating Bitcoins Ã— Bitcoin Price  
- = 19,348,206 Ã— $29,992.29  
- = $580,297,005,331.74  

### 2. How Is Bitcoin Dominance Calculated?

Bitcoin dominance is calculated by dividing Bitcoin's market cap by the total cryptocurrency market cap and expressing the result as a percentage.

- **Bitcoin Dominance** = Bitcoin Market Cap / Total Crypto Market Cap  

For example, if the total crypto market cap is $1.2 trillion, Bitcoinâ€™s 50% dominance would correspond to $600 billion.

### 3. The Relationship Between Bitcoin Dominance and Market Trends

The overall crypto market cap often mirrors Bitcoin's movements, as Bitcoin is the first, largest, and most widely recognized cryptocurrency. Historically, altcoins have shown a strong positive correlation with Bitcoin, responding to its price movements.

Bitcoin dominance helps investors analyze altcoin market trends and predict potential shifts in the crypto market.

## Why Is Bitcoin Dominance Important?

Bitcoin has historically been the most prominent and widely adopted cryptocurrency. Changes in its dominance often signal shifts in the crypto market. Hereâ€™s why Bitcoin dominance matters:

1. **Market Sentiment**: High Bitcoin dominance typically indicates a bullish trend, with investors placing more trust in Bitcoin compared to other cryptocurrencies. Conversely, low dominance suggests a bearish trend and increased attention on altcoins.
   
2. **Fear and Greed Index**: Bitcoin dominance is a key factor in the crypto Fear and Greed Index, a market sentiment indicator. Rising dominance often signals fear, while declining dominance may indicate growing greed and speculation in altcoins.

3. **Altcoin Season Predictor**: Bitcoin dominance is one of the most reliable indicators for predicting altcoin seasons, where multiple altcoins experience rapid price increases against Bitcoin and USD.

4. **Trading Strategies**: Traders use Bitcoin dominance to assess market strength and make informed decisions, such as identifying buy or sell signals based on the dominance trend.

## A Historical Overview of Bitcoin Dominance

Bitcoin dominance has evolved significantly since its launch in 2009. Hereâ€™s a timeline of key milestones:

### 2009â€“2016: Early Dominance
- Bitcoin accounted for 99% of the crypto market upon launch in 2009, as the industry was still nascent.
- By 2013, Bitcoinâ€™s dominance remained above 90%, despite the emergence of altcoins like Litecoin.

### 2017â€“2018: The ICO Boom
- Bitcoinâ€™s dominance dropped from 96% in early 2017 to 37% in early 2018 due to the ICO frenzy.
- The rise of Ethereum and speculative investments in new tokens contributed to this decline.

### 2019â€“2020: Halving and DeFi Growth
- Bitcoin dominance rebounded to 60â€“70% following its 2020 halving.  
- However, the DeFi boom in 2020 caused a temporary decline to 55%.

### 2021â€“2022: Altcoin and NFT Mania
- Bitcoin dominance fell below 40% in 2021 due to the rise of altcoins, DeFi, and NFTs.
- In 2022, dominance hovered around 40â€“50% as the market adjusted.

## Factors Affecting Bitcoin Dominance

Several factors influence Bitcoin dominance, including:

### 1. Bitcoin Price Volatility
Bitcoinâ€™s market cap is directly affected by its price. As Bitcoin's price rises, its dominance often increases, though this can vary based on altcoin performance.

### 2. Altcoin Market Trends
The emergence of altcoins with diverse use cases, such as DeFi, NFTs, and real-world assets, can impact Bitcoinâ€™s dominance. Stablecoins also play a significant role by providing liquidity and preserving capital during market downturns.

### 3. New Cryptocurrency Launches
The introduction of new cryptocurrencies increases the total crypto market cap, often reducing Bitcoinâ€™s dominance temporarily.

## Why Bitcoin Dominance Rose Rapidly in 2023

Since March 2023, Bitcoin dominance has surged due to two main reasons:

1. **Altcoin Decline**: SEC lawsuits against major exchanges labeled many altcoins as securities, causing their prices to drop significantly. Bitcoinâ€™s relative stability contributed to its increased market share.

2. **Institutional Adoption**: As a perceived safe-haven asset, Bitcoin attracted significant capital from traditional financial institutions, further boosting its dominance.

## The Impact of Rising Bitcoin Dominance

Historically, an increase in Bitcoin dominance has signaled the onset of altcoin seasons. As investors take profits from Bitcoin, they often reinvest in altcoins, driving their prices higher.

If current trends persist, Bitcoinâ€™s dominance may continue to rise. However, as market confidence returns, altcoins could experience significant rebounds, particularly Ethereum.

An altcoin rally could lead to gains of 10% or more, pushing Ethereumâ€™s price above $2,000 and signaling broader recovery in the crypto market.

Bitcoin dominance remains a critical indicator for understanding market trends and identifying profitable opportunities in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies.

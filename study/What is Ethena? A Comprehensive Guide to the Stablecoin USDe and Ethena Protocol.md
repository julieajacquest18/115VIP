## What is Ethena?

Ethena (ENA) is a decentralized stablecoin protocol developed by Ethena Labs on the Ethereum blockchain. The project offers a unique stablecoin called USDe, which distinguishes itself from traditional stablecoins like USDT or USDC. Unlike these coins, which are typically backed by fiat reserves, USDe achieves price stability through collateralized crypto assets and short derivative positions.

### Delta Neutral Strategy

The key mechanism behind Ethenaâ€™s stablecoin is its use of a "Delta Neutral" strategy. This is a financial technique that mitigates the impact of asset price volatility on a portfolio. For USDe, this means that if the collateralâ€™s value decreases, the system protects its reserves using derivative contracts to maintain stability.

## How Does the USDe Stablecoin Work?

When a user deposits approximately $100 worth of stETH as collateral, Ethena mints around 100 USDe after deducting the costs associated with executing hedge positions. Ethena Labs uses this collateral to open short perpetual contract positions on derivatives exchanges, ensuring asset stability.

### Custody and Security

To mitigate risks, Ethena Labs employs MPA custody services for stETH collateral. These assets are held with off-chain settlement providers rather than on centralized exchanges. This approach safeguards the collateral from risks such as hacking or exchange insolvency.

### High APY on USDe

As of this writing, the annual percentage yield (APY) for USDe is an impressive **37.1%**. This high yield is derived from two primary sources:
1. Passive staking rewards from liquid staking tokens (LST) like stETH.
2. Funding rates or spreads from perpetual contract positions.

Additionally, only users who stake USDe earn rewards, increasing the share of rewards for active participants.

## Ethena Ecosystem and Developments

### Strategic Funding Rounds

In February 2024, Ethena Labs announced the completion of a $14 million strategic funding round led by Dragonfly and Maelstrom, the family office of BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes. The protocol was valued at $300 million during this round.

Previously, Ethena Labs raised $6.5 million in a seed funding round in July 2023, with participation from major players like OKX, Bybit, and Gemini.

### ENA Governance Token and Airdrops

In April 2024, Ethena launched its governance token ENA through an airdrop campaign. A total of 15 billion ENA tokens will be issued, with initial circulating supply at 1.425 billion tokens. The airdrop distributed approximately 750 million tokens to eligible participants, based on activity metrics and NFT holdings.

## Risks and Community Concerns

As a new decentralized stablecoin protocol, Ethena is not without risks. Prominent DeFi figure Andre Cronje recently expressed concerns about the sustainability of Ethenaâ€™s mechanisms during market downturns. Key risks include:
- **Smart Contract Risk**: Potential vulnerabilities in the protocol.
- **Liquidity Risk**: Insufficient liquidity for users.
- **Custody Risk**: Dependence on third-party custodians.
- **Funding Rate Risk**: Adverse funding rate conditions.

It is essential for users to evaluate their risk tolerance before participating.

## Ethenaâ€™s Second Campaign: Sats Campaign

Ethenaâ€™s ongoing **Sats Campaign** allows users to earn additional rewards through staking and holding USDe. Options include:
- **Locking USDe**: 20x points with a 7-day lock-up.
- **Holding USDe**: 5x points for simply holding.
- **Staking USDe for sUSDe**: 2x points with a 35% APY.

Participants from the first campaign who continue staking can earn an additional 20% bonus.

## Conclusion

Ethena offers an innovative approach to decentralized stablecoins with its Delta Neutral strategy and high APY returns. However, like any DeFi project, it comes with inherent risks. For users interested in participating, understanding the mechanisms and potential pitfalls is critical. Whether you're staking USDe or participating in governance, Ethena is shaping the future of decentralized finance.

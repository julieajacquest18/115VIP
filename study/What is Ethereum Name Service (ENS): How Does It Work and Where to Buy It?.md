# What is Ethereum Name Service (ENS): How Does It Work and Where to Buy It?

Weâ€™ve all encountered cryptocurrency addressesâ€”a long string of randomly assigned numbers and letters. These addresses can often lead to confusion and even loss of funds since even a minor error can have catastrophic effects. Just one missing character can cause chaos.

## Introducing the Future

[Ethereum Name Service (ENS)](https://ens.domains/) is here to eliminate the hassle of reading and managing complex cryptocurrency addresses.

Built on the [Ethereum](https://coinkickoff.com/zh_hk/%E4%BB%A5%E5%A4%AA%E5%9D%8A-eth/) blockchain, ENS replaces long and complex wallet addresses with something more user-friendly, like a URL or email address.

For example, instead of an address like `0xLC65BA3F5C8A186128358A2ADA83795RBA0D895M`, ENS can simplify it to something like `Adam.eth`. This makes it much more practical and easier to remember.

ENS works similarly to how DNS (Domain Name System) matches IP addresses with domain names. It maps your crypto internet protocol address to a simple, shareable, and memorable name.

## How Does Ethereum Name Service (ENS) Work?

**ENS operates using two Ethereum smart contracts.**

1. **ENS Registry:** This registry stores every ENS domain name and its corresponding IP address in the network. It keeps key details about each domain, such as:
   - The owner
   - Cache time
   - Resolver

2. **Resolver Contract:** The resolver contract maps domain names to readable addresses. It matches each domain to its corresponding websites, wallet addresses, and users.

## What Is ENS Used For?

Essentially, ENS domains simplify your crypto transactions by converting long, complex addresses into easy-to-read and practical ones. This feature makes it:
- Easier to receive crypto assets.
- Convenient to interact with Ethereum dApps without copying and pasting lengthy addresses.

Moreover, ENS plays a vital role in building [Web 3.0](https://coinkickoff.com/zh_hk/what-is-web-3-0/) by collaborating with file storage systems like IPFS. Most `.eth` websites can be accessed through crypto wallets like [MetaMask](https://coinkickoff.com/zh_hk/what-is-metamask/). In some cases, you can even add `.link` to your decentralized website, making it accessible without a specialized browser or wallet.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Ethereum Name Service (ENS)

### How Long Has ENS Been Around?

The ENS project was launched in 2017 by Nick Johnson and Alex Van de Sande from the Ethereum Foundation. Thanks to the permissionless nature of Ethereum smart contracts, anyone can interact with the ENS protocol.

In November 2021, ENS airdropped its tokens to users and established a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to govern these tokens. True Names Limited, a private company, serves as the legal entity supporting ENS.

The ENS token functions similarly to shareholder assets in a company, enabling holders to vote on protocol changes, platform updates, pricing, and treasury management.

### What Controversies Surround Ethereum Name Service?

While the ENS protocol has not faced much controversy, its former director Brantly Millegan came under scrutiny for offensive tweets. This led to a vote by token holders to remove him, with **1.6 million** voting against him and **1.4 million** in favor.

He was later dismissed by True Names Limited but retained a role within the ENS DAO as token holders manage the organization.

### How Many ENS Tokens Exist?

The total supply of ENS tokens is **100 million**, with a circulating supply of just over **20 million** tokens.

### Can You Mine ENS Tokens?

While ENS tokens are built on the Ethereum blockchain, thereâ€™s no clarity on whether they can be mined. These ERC-20 tokens can be converted into NFTs, making them useful for governance and utility within the ENS protocol.

### What Is ENSâ€™s Market Capitalization?

As of writing, the market capitalization of ENS is **$305,404,233**, with a 24-hour trading volume of **$128,497,222**. The fully diluted market cap is **$1,508,867,463**, ranking ENS at **#116** on CoinMarketCap.

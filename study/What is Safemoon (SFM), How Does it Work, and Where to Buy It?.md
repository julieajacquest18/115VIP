## Introduction to Safemoon (SFM)

**Safemoon** is a popular blockchain project that has garnered significant investment and support over the past few months. This protocol aims to provide token holders with profitable earning mechanisms by introducing unique utilities and incorporating a deflationary model into its tokenomics.

## How Does Safemoon (SFM) Work?

Safemoon operates as a blockchain protocol built around its native **SFM token**, combining reflective tokenomics with auto-liquidity generation to maximize functionality. Over 400 trillion tokens have been permanently removed from circulation through its deflationary mechanism.

### Key Mechanics:

1. **Transaction Fee Model**:  
   Every SFM transaction incurs a **10% fee**, which is divided as follows:
   - **5%** is redistributed to SFM holders.  
   - The remaining **5%** is further split into two halves:
     - One half is converted into **Binance Coin (BNB)** and added to the liquidity pool on **PancakeSwap** through smart contracts.
     - The other half is sold into BNB.

2. **Incentives for Holders**:  
   This model rewards long-term holders with steady returns while discouraging token sales through penalty fees, contributing to price stability.

3. **Community Engagement**:  
   Safemoonâ€™s dedicated community, known as the "Safemoon Army," plays a vital role in supporting the project. Despite price volatility, the protocol's tokenomics encourage holders to retain their tokens instead of converting them to fiat.

### Evolution with Safemoon V2:
Safemoon V2 introduced a **1000-to-1 token consolidation**, reducing the token supply while maintaining focus on liquidity pool acquisition, reflections, growth funds, and continuous token burns.

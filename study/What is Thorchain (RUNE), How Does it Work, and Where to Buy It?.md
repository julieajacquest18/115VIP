# What is Thorchain (RUNE), How Does it Work, and Where to Buy It?

---

## Introduction to Thorchain (RUNE)

Thorchain is a blockchain protocol built on the **Cosmos** ecosystem, powered by its native token **RUNE**. It operates as a decentralized exchange (DEX), enabling users to seamlessly buy, sell, borrow, and lend native assets across multiple blockchains without wrapping tokens.

As one of the most popular blockchain projects, Thorchain (RUNE) is currently the fourth-largest DEX globally by market capitalization.

## How Thorchain (RUNE) Works

The goal of Thorchain is to eliminate centralization in cryptocurrency trading. Centralized exchanges (CEXs) often control user assets, leading to the well-known phrase: *"Not your keys, not your coins."* Thorchain addresses these issues by providing a decentralized liquidity protocol for cross-chain swaps.

### Key Features:

1. **Decentralized Liquidity Pools**:  
   Users can participate in liquidity pools by providing liquidity for two tokens, earning rewards in RUNE or other tokens. These pools power all transactions on the DEX.
   
2. **Double Swap Mechanism**:  
   Thorchain uses RUNE as an intermediary for trades. For example:
   - Token A is swapped for RUNE.
   - RUNE is then swapped for Token B.  
   This ensures seamless, instant trades.

3. **Node Operators and Validators**:  
   Operators must bond twice the amount of funds held in liquidity pools. This ensures network stability and incentivizes proper operation. Transaction fees are distributed between liquidity providers and nodes.

### Optimal Bonding:  
Thorchain achieves balance when 33% of RUNE is staked, and 67% is bonded by nodes. Overbonded nodes receive fewer fees, incentivizing a stable network structure.

## Use Cases of Thorchain (RUNE)

Thorchain provides decentralized solutions for cryptocurrency traders, including:

- **Trading**: Decentralized trading of native crypto assets without wrapping them into network-specific tokens like ERC20 or BEP20.

RUNE is the fuel behind all transactions, paying for fees and powering liquidity pools. It also plays a role in governance, ensuring community-driven decision-making.
